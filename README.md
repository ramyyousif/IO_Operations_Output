# IO_Operations_Output
Simple training on output operations.

This specific training is for pupils who are about to take an exam. The printed paper has the total amount of 
students and the number ID of each student. The student then simply has to sign the paper to say they are present.
I left a registration form as a .txt file to show an example.
